# BIOI3--Genes-Protiens-and-Genomic-Alignment
Series of python files used to complete the third course of Coursera's Bioinformatics Specialization from UC San Diego

- The minimum coins algorithm provides the foundation for sequence alignment algorithms to rapidly find the most matches and minimum indels/mismatches between two sequences

- The "Manhattan Tourist Problem" takes weighted directed acyclic graphs (Grid format) to find the longest path starting from the top left of the grid to the lower right, utilizing dynamic programing to run in O(n*m) time
